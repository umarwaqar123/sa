SECURITY AWARENESS
Why learning about security? Whose responsibility to get secure?
•	In our industry health care, Preserving the confidentiality, the privacy and security of health-related info in addition to company info. 
•	We work in health care dealing PH1,  learning and adopting security purposes is our responsibility. 
Phishing Attack:
•	Phishing is a type of attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. an attempt, made through email. This is different from spam emails. 
Spam:

Antispam:
•	Many of modern legitimate email campaign tools would have an option to opt-out (unsubscribe) hacker email. But instead, hacker email would not have that option. 
Phishing statistics:
•	Around 160 million phishing scams are email each year. 
•	10% 16 million make it through filters. 
How to detect phishing attack:
•	Phishing attack may or may not use your name. 
•	May appears to come from legitimate organization (bank, companies etc.)
•	May ask you to identify to confirm your info, such as you credit card number SSN, account numb er, password etc.
•	May appear to come from some body who you know sharing a document or link. 
Prevent from phishing attack:
•	Prevent by questing the compliance with security practices, check for spelling mistakes, unusual aspects or behaviors, investigate the validity.
#Suspicious Links:

•	Copy and paste on a notepad.
What if it looks legitimate?
•	May be work user account got compromise.
•	Follow company policies. Your works, IT department, banks etc, will never ask for passwords or login info by email.

Social engineering:
•	When a person attempts to manipulate some one in order to obtain access to confidential info as restricted areas that would otherwise not be given. 
What is type of info usually transited?
•	Passwords, username, bank info, personal IDs, access to computers. Private or restricted areas, such as server rooms. 
How it works and how it’s done?
    How does it work?
•	It is usually easier to exploit someone’s trust  than to hack a protected system access.
•	Much easier to trick someone into giving their passwords than to hack a strong complex secure alphanumeric password. 
    How it is done?
•	Can  be performed over the phone, online such by email, or even in person. 
•	Most people will never ask to verify some one identity if they show up in professional attire and fake an emergency situation.
Who is being attacked?
•	People who part of their role is to access other’s people info. 
•	Human resource, IT departments, Accounting, are some and etc. 
•	Any one in regards to their own info.
Example are: fake employment verification checks, false passwords reset, etc.
Preventing Social engineering:
#What can you do to prevent?
•	Increase awareness of topic.
•	Never give out usernames of other people.
•	Never gives out passwords unless specifically authorized. 
•	Never gives out IDs or employees numbers.
•	Never gives server info or system info.
•	Never gives out financial info or schedules

#What else can you do to prevents?
•	Prevent shared sensitive Data. 
•	Watch out of phishing attack. 
•	Use fake but memorable info for security questions. 
•	Tighten up your social media presence. 
•	Ask for IDs.
#Social engineering methods prevention:
•	Over the phone 
1.	Obtain a callback
2.	Number to verify and call back
3.	Ask why they need info
4.	Get full name,job title and contact info.
•	Online
1.	Beware of phishing.
2.	Do not give out passwords. 
3.	Look for suspicious links 
4.	Call them instead of giving info via email.
•	In person
1.	Don’t fell pressured by any body, client or else. 
2.	Verify identity 
3.	If they ask for somebody else info dived to appropriate person.
4.	Do not let people follow in secure areas. 

#What is data leakage? 
•	The unauthorized transfer of info, whether sensitive or confidential, or not. 
There are two form of it. 
1.	Intentional: more rare but possible employees trying to sabotage to company, or leaking data to tother companies. 
2.	Accidental: most common, hardest to prevent, accidents and mistakes do happen. 
#Examples of Accidental Data leakage:
•	Sending confidential documents to an unauthorized person or wrong person via email, fax, mail. 
•	Hitting reply all and sending data to everyone. 
•	Talking about sensitive data on the phone in public. 
•	Having work documents or leaving systems access open on you laptop/phone around unauthorized people, even family. 
•	Not shredding sensitive paper documents.
•	Hitting reply all and sending data to everyone. 

#How to prevent Data leakage?
1.	Be careful and be mindful when dealing with sensitive data.
1.	Make sure you have the correct recipient (beware of similar names)
2.	Correct documents. 
3.	Correct medium, not everything needs to be done via email.
4.	Beware of surroundings  
•	Beware of surroundings.
1.	Do not allow unauthorized people do look over your shoulders. If you most work in open area with people facing your screen, get a privacy screen. 
2.	Do not let other people hear confidential conversations. 
3.	Do not leave sensitive documents accessible to unauthorized people. 
•	Secure your devices.
1.	Use secure passwords 
2.	Set devices and systems to lack after a certain period of times. 
3.	Do not leave them unlocked.  Set difficult to guests unlock codes. 
•	Do not dump sensitive documents in regular garbage, but shred them to make impossible to put them together. 
•	Train the work force and all individuals to have and share a good security awareness mindset. 
#Encryption:
Sensitive data should be encryptive.
•	Used to scramble or encode a message or a file so that unauthorized users can’t access it, tamper with or steal sensitive info in order to access the encrypted info a key must be use to decrypt the info, making this process a two-way process. 

How to set a strong password?
•	The typical 8 characters minimum  upper case, lowercase,  number or symbol is not holding up any more password strength comes from length. 
•	Length exponentially increases password possibilities. 8 character long would lead to 700 trillions years to crack, which seems a lot, but with modern computing power that takes minutes, instead a fairly computer passwords of 9 character, Just one more will lead to 50 quadrillion possibilities, taking much longer to crack. 
•	If provided with security question to restore a password use fake but memorable ones in order to avoid social engineering. 
A good recipe to create strong password is following. 
•	Create a unique password for each system access, this way if compromised others systems are compromised. 
•	Make them fairly completed and fairly long to easy remember.  
•	Make sure they are using 3rd party password strength checker. 
•	Use a password manager tool to generate strong password or stores them i.e password for apple “edge password manager” with authentication for windows and other devices and other devices dedicated apps like 
1.	Bitwarden
2.	1 password 
3.	Last pass
Authentication:
Process of verifying identity of users. 
3 types of authentications. 
•	Something you know i.e., passwords, pins, swipe combination most common sometime you have keys, access cards, access codes. 
•	Something you are or do i.e., finger prints, voice recognitions, walk patterns. 
•	MFA or 2FA multifactor authentication, is when you combine more than 1 factor to authenticate to increase security i.e., username and passwords, then access codes received by email. Message, or authentication app. This combines type 1 and 2. 
•	It adds an extra step. But it is worth it.

#Safe browsing:
•	Use secure connection. To see you connection is secure seek for a lock symbol besides websites URLS it tell you are secured (encryption or not).
•	Avoid suspicious links. 
•	Link start with HTTPS means secure.
•	If site is on HTTP and lock icon missing, or red the connection is not secure. In this case you must not provide sensitive info because in this case info is transferred in plain text not encrypted. 
#HTTPS:
•	Hyper text transfer protocol secure is a extension of hyper text transfer protocol use to secure communication over a computer network. 
•	Communication protocol is encrypted using TLS transport layer security. 
#Public Wi-Fi:
•	Careful using internet on pubic Wi-Fi. 
•	It may be called public guest but you can’t be sure who are connection to. 
•	System and devices are set to remember prior connected networks prior connected networks to reconnect next time. 
•	You are connecting to hacker Wi-Fi not public Wi-Fi is called Evil twin attack. 
#Private home internet:
•	Must you connection is password protected. 
•	Router has fairly long complex passwords.  
•	You must be considered about surrounding and what is right to do to protect you account. 
•	Call the IT department or security officer for access help. 
#How to secure personal device. 
•	Use strong password, pin codes, finger prints, face lock. 
•	Do not install apps from third party sources but through official sources. 
•	Do not allow access permission. 
•	Do not install browser extension.  
•	Fully encrypted devices. 
•	Clear cache, cookies. 
•	Remote wiping. 
#Upgrade or selling
•	Must wipe out all data before reselling. 
•	You must do hand erase not just simple rest in case of computers or laptops. 
•	Be mindful, be careful and be considerate. 
#Removable storage, public computers and updates. 
•	USB and external devices if contain sensitive data must secured. 
•	Clean encrypted and password protected. 
•	Do not use public computer for company related matter because key loggers can capture every key stroke and ease data leakage.
•	You must install security updates as soon as if they are available. 
#VPN:
Virtual private network software that can run on mobile devices/laptop/ desktops to change IP address, and encrypted your data. 
Advantages of VPN.; Can use public wi-fi with vpn , stay more private. 
Dis adv:’ May slow down your traffic speed. There is cost. 
#How credit card secure:
•	Always use HTTPS websites. 
•	Second credit card if you have use for online shopping. 
•	Enable all security end notification features of your credit card vendor. 
•	You do not need to trust the vendor. Trust built on consumer experience. i.e. amazon is safe.
